# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit 
In this project we were given a csv file which contained the election results. We then used python to write code in order to read the csv file and get the information required by the Colorado Board of Elections and display it in a text file. For the challange part of the project we had to modify/add code to our orginial code in order to get some additional data to complete the election audit:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results

When we run the code we get the following ttxt file as an ouput:

We can use the above output to answer the following questions:
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  369,711 Votes were cast
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct
-
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
  Denver with 82.8% of the total votes or 306,055 people who voted were from Denver County
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
