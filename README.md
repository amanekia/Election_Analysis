# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit 
In this project we were given a csv file which contained the election results. We then used python to write code in order to read the csv file and get the information required by the Colorado Board of Elections and display it in a text file. For the challange part of the project we had to modify/add code to our orginial code in order to get some additional data to complete the election audit:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
